							<h5>"Balkancar is a Bulgarian company for research and manufacturing of electrical vehicles for the production industry."</h5>
							<div style="height:200px;"><img src="balkancar.jpg" alt="WiFi" style="height:200px;"></div>
							<p>The first electrical driven forklift in Bulgaria was produced in 1951 in the tram and trolleybus factory "September 6" in Sofia. The production of forklifts in Bulgaria is one of the sectors of the mechanical engineering which contains significant world achievements. With the development of the first experimental series of lifting and transport machines in 1952, production grew and improved. At the end of the 1970s, Bulgaria led the world in the number of forklifts it produced.

As well as the main assembly factories, the Balkancar association in the 1980s also included enterprises for the production of intermediate products used in the creation of electric and forklift trucks. At the end of the 1980's, it had 39 divisions - 31 in the country and 8 abroad. Its factories also produce buses, cars, and bicycles.

In Bulgaria, the traditions in the production and supply of high quality and affordable lifting and transport equipment under the brand "Balkancar" continue to be produced, albeit on a much smaller scale than in the past. Different types of industrial vehicles are produced: electric trucks, forklifts, platform trucks, tugs, and hoists</p>
							<p>1952 - the first Bulgarian platform electric truck was produced.</p>

<p>1957 - the first 150 Electric Low forklift trucks were exported to USSR and Czechoslovakia.</p>

<p>1964 - the first joint-venture companies for sales of industrial trucks with the trade mark of Balkancar were established.</p>

<p>1966 - the first engine-powered forklift truck was produced.</p>

<p>1975 - the annual forklift production exceeded 50 000 pieces.</p>

<p>1978 - Balkancar took first place in general production of industrial trucks in the world, ahead of producers like TOYOTA, NISSAN, CLARK.</p>

<p>1992 - the million-and-a-half industrial truck was produced.</p>	
<p>BALKANCAR RUEN in Assenovgrad supplied other factories with chassis units and componets from 1967, being a spacialized member of the Bulgarian industrial truck family. In the beginning the plant was engaged in the supply of parts for electrical-powered trucks service network in Bulgaria and abroad. After that, the management expanded their activties and started supplying all industrial truck assembly plants in Bulgaria.

The product list of BALKANCAR RUEN included sets of wheels with solid tyres for electric-powered trucks, flexible couplings and pipe joints for hydraulic systems, servo-brakes, etc. The products of Assenovgrad company were not unique, but of proved reliability, good technical parameters, quality and prices.</p>

								<h2>This Magical Device Easily Fixes Slow Internet!</h2>
								<h5>"This is how thousands of people are getting lighting fast internet at home without paying a fortune..."</h5>
								<h6>By Lily Yarish August 3th, 2020 Technology</h6>
								<div style="height:200px;"><img src="wifi.jpg" alt="WiFi" style="height:200px;"></div>
								<p>Want to know how thousands of people in Bulgaria are receiving super-fast internet speed for a fraction of the costs?</p>
								<p>Thanks to SuperBoost WiFi, you can now join thousands of Bulgaria and enjoy super-fast internet in the comfort of your home.</p>
								<p>SuperBoost WiFi came to life after an engineer developed an obsession to solve his slow internet problem. While researching for a solution, he noticed a very common theme - internet users were provided with weaker routers, resulting in slower internet, by their ISPs.
								And for them to simply get faster internet, they needed to call and upgrade their plans. This deception lead to more money for the company, and it didn't sit right to him.
								So, he created a device that strengthened the Wi-Fi signal across any house – and SuperBoost WiFi was born. “The best thing about SuperBoost WiFi, is that it’s so simple, anyone can use it!”
								SuperBoost WiFi is now available to <a href="https://ctotrk.com/click">order online</a> , so get your hands on one before they go on back order.</p>

								<h2>Concerned About Zoom Security? Here’s How Using a VPN Can Keep You More Secure</h2>
								<h5>Best VPNs for Zoom Security & Safety in 2020</h5>
								<div style="height:200px;"><img src="zoom.jpg" alt="WiFi" style="height:200px;"></div>
								<p>Over the last few weeks, Zoom has gone from useful video calling app to an absolute household name.</p>
								<p>User numbers have grown exponentially, as Covid-19 lockdown has inspired the public to find new and creative</p>
								<p>ways to enjoy human contact in digital form – so why would a VPN help?Zoom’s quickly inflated userbase</p>
								<p>(the app has been downloaded more than 50 million times on Google Play store alone)</p>
								<p>has also brought greater scrutiny over the service and now questions are being raised over its privacy practices,</p>
								 <p>vulnerability to hijackers and apparent lack of true end-to-end encryption. In a time when we’re using our computers<p>
								 <p>and phones to share more data with each other than ever before, that’s a potentially worrying development.</p>

								<p>“K2-18b, also known as EPIC 201912552 b, is an exoplanet orbiting the red dwarf K2-18, located 124 light-years (38 pc) away from Earth. The planet is a mini-neptune about 2.6 times the radius of Earth, with a 33-day orbit within the star's habitable zone. This means it receives about a similar amount of starlight as the Earth receives from the Sun. Initially discovered with the Kepler space telescope, it was later observed by the James Webb Space Telescope in order to study the planet's atmosphere.”</p>
