								<h2>This Magical Device Easily Fixes Slow Internet!</h2>
								<h5>"This is how thousands of people are getting lighting fast internet at home without paying a fortune..."</h5>
								<h6>By Lily Yarish August 3th, 2020 Technology</h6>
								<div style="height:200px;"><img src="wifi.jpg" alt="WiFi" style="height:200px;"></div>
								<p>Want to know how thousands of people in Bulgaria are receiving super-fast internet speed for a fraction of the costs?</p>
								<p>Thanks to SuperBoost WiFi, you can now join thousands of Bulgaria and enjoy super-fast internet in the comfort of your home.</p>
								<p>SuperBoost WiFi came to life after an engineer developed an obsession to solve his slow internet problem. While researching for a solution, he noticed a very common theme - internet users were provided with weaker routers, resulting in slower internet, by their ISPs.
								And for them to simply get faster internet, they needed to call and upgrade their plans. This deception lead to more money for the company, and it didn't sit right to him.
								So, he created a device that strengthened the Wi-Fi signal across any house – and SuperBoost WiFi was born. “The best thing about SuperBoost WiFi, is that it’s so simple, anyone can use it!”
								SuperBoost WiFi is now available to <a href="https://ctotrk.com/click">order online</a> , so get your hands on one before they go on back order.</p>

								<h5>Best VPNs for Zoom Security & Safety in 2020</h5>
								<div style="height:200px;"><img src="zoom.jpg" alt="WiFi" style="height:200px;"></div>
								<p>Over the last few weeks, Zoom has gone from useful video calling app to an absolute household name.</p>
								<p>User numbers have grown exponentially, as Covid-19 lockdown has inspired the public to find new and creative</p>
								<p>ways to enjoy human contact in digital form – so why would a VPN help?Zoom’s quickly inflated userbase</p>
								<p>(the app has been downloaded more than 50 million times on Google Play store alone)</p>
								<p>has also brought greater scrutiny over the service and now questions are being raised over its privacy practices,</p>
								 <p>vulnerability to hijackers and apparent lack of true end-to-end encryption. In a time when we’re using our computers<p>
								 <p>and phones to share more data with each other than ever before, that’s a potentially worrying development.</p>

								<p>“You want to wake up in the morning and think the future is going to be great - and that’s what being a spacefaring civilization is all about.
